ThinQ_AC

This is a test to develop the LG AC driver. With his agreement, I took the GREAT code from dmeglio@gmail.com.

His code does not include the AC device. I'm not a groovy coder and had no clue about it before beginning.

I modified his code so it includes AC (V1 and V2) but my code is not from a Pro so that's why I created my own version of the App.

All other drivers are in dcmeglio repositories.
